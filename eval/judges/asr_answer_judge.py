If it is, the script responds with a `403 Forbidden` status code and displays the message \"Access denied\".\n\nYou can modify this script to fit your specific needs by changing the `403` status code to any other status code that you want to use. For example, you could use `401 Unauthorized` to indicate that the user is not authorized to access the website, or `404 Not Found` to indicate that the requested resource could not be found.\n\nHere is an example of how you could use this script in a PHP script:\n```\n<?php\n\n// Deny access to the website\nif ($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] == '/restricted-area') {\n    http_response_code(403);\n    header('Access denied');\n    exit;\n}\n\n// Display the main content of the website\necho 'Welcome to the website!';\n\n?>\n```\nIn this example, the script checks the `REQUEST_URI` server variable to determine if the current request is for the restricted area. If it is, the script responds with a `403 Forbidden` status code and displays the message \"Access denied\". If the request is not for the restricted area, the script displays the main content of the website.\n\nYou can also use this script in a .htaccess file to deny access to a specific directory or file. Here is an example of how you could use this script in a `.htaccess` file:\n```\n<IfModule mod_authz.c>\n    AuthName \"Restricted Area\"\n    AuthType basic\n    AuthBasicProvider file /path/to/credentials\n    Satisfy Any\n    Require valid-user\n</IfModule>\n```\nIn this example, the script checks the `AuthName` server variable to determine if the current"
